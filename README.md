### Comp Fi Stuff

- Python implementations of various results / equations covered during my 4th year Computational Finance course
- I mainly produced this for revision purposes - probably not useful irl in any way
- The functions supposedly not only return the correct values but also print out the steps to get there
- `tutorials/` contains applications of the functions to the tutorial sheets provided for the course
